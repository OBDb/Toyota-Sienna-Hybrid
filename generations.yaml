    description: "The Toyota Sienna Hybrid represents Toyota's comprehensive approach to electrification by making a hybrid powertrain standard across the entire fourth-generation Sienna lineup, rather than offering it as a separate variant like many other models. Built on Toyota's TNGA-K platform, the Sienna Hybrid features the same bold, SUV-inspired styling as all fourth-generation Siennas, with a massive front grille, muscular wheel arches, and distinctive side character lines creating a far more adventurous appearance than traditional minivans. The hybrid powertrain combines a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine with electric motors for a combined 245 horsepower, paired with an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (eCVT). While this represents less power than the previous generation's V6, the hybrid system delivers substantially improved fuel economy of 36 mpg combined in front-wheel drive modelsâ€”a nearly 50% increase over the previous generation and exceptional for a vehicle of this size and capacity. The hybrid system uses a nickel-metal hydride battery positioned under the front seats to avoid intrusion into passenger or cargo space. All-wheel drive is available through the addition of a third electric motor powering the rear wheels, reducing combined fuel economy only slightly to 35 mpg. The interior features a bridge console design with raised center section, creating a more car-like driving position while maintaining minivan practicality with available features including built-in vacuum cleaner, refrigerator, digital rearview mirror, and a rear entertainment system. The sliding second-row captain's chairs in higher trims feature an extraordinary 25 inches of travel to maximize legroom or cargo flexibility. Available in multiple trim levels from the basic LE to the luxury-oriented Platinum to the more rugged Woodland Edition with increased ground clearance, the Sienna Hybrid offers configurations to suit various preferences while all delivering the same efficient powertrain. Standard safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 offering pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, full-speed dynamic radar cruise control, lane departure alert with steering assist, and automatic high beams. By making the hybrid powertrain standard across the lineup rather than a premium option, Toyota has positioned the fourth-generation Sienna to appeal to efficiency-minded families while eliminating the complexity of separate hybrid and non-hybrid variants, streamlining production and helping normalize hybrid technology in a mainstream family vehicle."
